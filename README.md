# Subcortical-Allometry-in-Autism


This repository contains the scripts used to analyses the [Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange I](http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/abide/abide_I.html) (ABIDE I) dataset by Williams et al. (in prep). The study preregistration is available [here](https://osf.io/6bjcg). The data was obtained from [Lefebvre and colleagues (2015)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006322315001018?via%3Dihub). 

1. The data cleaning, inclusion, exclusion and transformations script is available in Scripts/Final_Clean_Data.R
2. Descriptive statistics scripts are available in Scripts/Demographics folder. 
3. The scripts used to examine whether scaling coefficients of each local volume is isometric, hypoallometric, or hyperallometric are in the Scripts/Allometry_Isometry folder.
